# taffy-jwt-api

In this example, I demonstrate how to create a simple REST API using the [Taffy framework](https://taffy.io/) and authenticate it with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). I utilize the [jwt-cfml](https://github.com/jcberquist/jwt-cfml) library to implement JWT in CFML.

Change the configuration variables inside the `config.cfm` file to your liking.

Run the command `docker-compose up -d` spin up the container.
